``The scope of a quantificational DP, on a given analysis of the sentence, is that part of the sentence which denotes a property that is asserted to be an element of the generalized quantifier denoted by the DP on that analysis.''


11
``The scope of an operator in logic is simply the constituent that it is attached to. All properties of absolute and relative scope follow from this.''

13
``Each time a property is formed, a quantifier can be introduced. The later a quantifier is introduced, the wider its scope: other operators may already be buried in teh definition of the property that it combines with, and therefore they fall within its scope.''

(Note: they do not treat the interaction of quantifiers and pronouns, such as in binding, in their book, see p. 14)

22
``pair-list quantifier'' (see 4.1.4)


********************************
CHAPTER 4--- Empirically significant properties of quantifiers and determiners

conservativity (see pages 45, 61-68, 70, 79, 210)

extension (see pages 7-8, 12, 20, 32, 45, 51, 62-65, 70, 81, 208)

45
``This book strictly follows the terminology that generalized quantifeirs are the denotations of full noun phrases like \textit{every dragon} and \textit{more than two dragons}. Expressions like \textit{every} and \textit{more than two} denote semantic determiners.''

51
monotonically decreasing: implication reversing, downward entailing

61
``{\ldots}we refer to expressions like \textit{every, most, more than half, at least two}, and so on as ``determiners'', and to their denotations as ``semantic determiners'', or as ``determiner denotations''.'' (KKC --- why not all in this list???)

States that \textit{every'} ``is decreasing in its noun argument and increasing in its predicate argument.''

Article treats mainly Swahili and Northern Sotho ``A literature review on quantification in (whatever) Bantu langauge reveals that few studies exist which touch upon quantification.'' 
383-384 ``The use of the pre-prefix for definiteness and specificity is among the issues related to quantification in the broadest sense that has attracted the most attention (for references see section 3).''
384 ``we follow the basic dichotomy proposed for English by Partee \textit{et al}. (1987) and address D-quantifiers, i.e. quantificational determiners in the nominal domain, and A-quantifiers, i.e. adverbial quantifers in the verbal domain, separately.''

2- QUANTIFICATION IN THE NOMINAL DOMAIN

386 ``With respect to word order, adjectives and demonstratives canonically follow the head noun in Bantu languages. Prenominal appearance is mainly possible for demonstratives{\ldots}The syntax of these constructions deserves further investigation{\ldots}''

387 ``In some Bantu languages, an interesting correlation of agreement pattern and the semantics of a quantifier can be found: In Swahili, e.g., the stem \textit{-ote} (`all') does not agree with the head noun according to adjective formation in contrast to stems like \emph{-engi} (`many') and the basic number words. Instead, \emph{-ote} (`all') requires, like demonstratives, pronominal concord (Krifka, 1995: 1389), which may point to a different status of these two items, `all' being more determiner like and `many' being more adjectival. 

``no consistent pattern emerges across languages'' (e.g. with `all')

2.2 INTERSECTIVE QUANTIFIERS

388 2.2.1. NON-NUMERAL INTERSECTIVE QUANTIFIERS. ``Intersective quantifiers are quantifiers whose truth conditions can be given in terms of the intersection of the noun meaning and the predicate meaning. The majority of intersective quanitifers in Bantu languages agrees with the quantifying head noun according to one of the agreement patterns listed in (2).''

The stem for `many' in Swahiii and Northern Sotho can be used ``with uncountables or mass nouns'' {\ldots}``hence there is no `many/much' distinction''

389
``adjectives and demonstratives canonically follow the head noun in Bantu languages. The same holds for quantifiers. However, in some Bantu languages at least, quantifiers can also precede the head noun{\ldots}As for the semantics of preposed quantifiers, the Northern Sotho example in (7a) is reperted to have an additional meaning of emphasis. The Mbalanhu example is reported not to differ in meaning from the sentence containing a postposed quantifier (Fourie, 1992: 107).''

in Northern Sotho, the stem that means `several' cannot be used with uncountable nouns. 

390
Bantu expressions meaning `few'

In some Bantu languages, the adjectives expressing size (small and big) can also be used for expressions of quantity

391
In NS, ``equivalent for English `some' is \textit{-ngwe}''

``The following two observations suggest that the quantity interpretation of \textit{-ngwe} derives from the plural of the head noun so that the important semantic contribution of \textit{-ngwe} is lack of definiteness.''

\textit{-ngwe} can also be used in the singular

392
Mojapelo (2007) suggests that semantically \textit{-ngwe} indicates that the object talked about is unidentifiable to the hearer unless the pragmatic context suggests otherwise. 

COUNTING SYSTEM

(No notes)

393
NEGATION

``N.S., like many other Bantu languages, does not have a negative quantifier in the nominal domain (see also Malete, 2003). Negative quantification is expressed by negation on the verb{\ldots}''

394
UNIVERSAL QUANTIFIERS

``For the quantifier expressing totality `all' and for the universal distributive quantifier `every', Bantu languages show different morphological stems and constructions with diverging syntactic and/or semantic properties.''

396

``As a general observation, the distributive universal quantifier `every' is expressed in a morphologically complex way or by a loan word in the Bantu languages under inspection for this article. It often shows morphosyntactic features that diverge from adnominal modifiers. In Swahili, the Arabic loan \textit{kila} is used. \textit{Kila} does not agree with the quantified noun in noun class features, and strictly precedes the noun{\ldots}''

``In Swahili, both \textit{kila} and \textit{-ote} can have a distributive reading. 

In light of some data presented in this text, a reviewer suggested that ``\textit{kila} is inherently distributive whereas \textit{-ote} is underspecified concerning the distributive/collective distinction.''

397

``In both Swahili and Northern Sotho, the universal quantifiers also allow for a free choice interpretation, i.e. that the speaker offers the addresee the choice of referent; the sentence will hold with any choice.

(Free choice = anyone, any people whatsoever, any house whatsoever)

398
PROPORTIONALITY QUANTIFIERS
``Proportionality quantifiers are expressed by complex (morpho)-syntactic constructions in Bantu languages.''


MOST `is not a morphological stem in many Bantu languages but is rendered by an analytical morphological construction.'

``The status of the construction that indicates that half of the members from a given set are participating in an event needs further investigation.''



399
Associative construction (discussion; Adams 2005 analyzes it as partitive)

``The quantifiers `many', `some', `each,' and `one' can consequently be used both with a proportional and with an absolute interpretation. In the proportional interpretation they need a restriction on the set over which they quantify. The restriciton is encoded by means of the associative construction.''

400
In ZULU, all cannot participate in this partitive construction.

Article treats mainly Swahili and Northern Sotho ``A literature review on quantification in (whatever) Bantu langauge reveals that few studies exist which touch upon quantification.'' 
383-384 ``The use of the pre-prefix for definiteness and specificity is among the issues related to quantification in the broadest sense that has attracted the most attention (for references see section 3).''
384 ``we follow the basic dichotomy proposed for English by Partee \textit{et al}. (1987) and address D-quantifiers, i.e. quantificational determiners in the nominal domain, and A-quantifiers, i.e. adverbial quantifers in the verbal domain, separately.''

2- QUANTIFICATION IN THE NOMINAL DOMAIN

386 ``With respect to word order, adjectives and demonstratives canonically follow the head noun in Bantu languages. Prenominal appearance is mainly possible for demonstratives{\ldots}The syntax of these constructions deserves further investigation{\ldots}''

387 ``In some Bantu languages, an interesting correlation of agreement pattern and the semantics of a quantifier can be found: In Swahili, e.g., the stem \textit{-ote} (`all') does not agree with the head noun according to adjective formation in contrast to stems like \emph{-engi} (`many') and the basic number words. Instead, \emph{-ote} (`all') requires, like demonstratives, pronominal concord (Krifka, 1995: 1389), which may point to a different status of these two items, `all' being more determiner like and `many' being more adjectival. 

``no consistent pattern emerges across languages'' (e.g. with `all')

2.2 INTERSECTIVE QUANTIFIERS

388 2.2.1. NON-NUMERAL INTERSECTIVE QUANTIFIERS. ``Intersective quantifiers are quantifiers whose truth conditions can be given in terms of the intersection of the noun meaning and the predicate meaning. The majority of intersective quanitifers in Bantu languages agrees with the quantifying head noun according to one of the agreement patterns listed in (2).''

The stem for `many' in Swahiii and Northern Sotho can be used ``with uncountables or mass nouns'' {\ldots}``hence there is no `many/much' distinction''

389
``adjectives and demonstratives canonically follow the head noun in Bantu languages. The same holds for quantifiers. However, in some Bantu languages at least, quantifiers can also precede the head noun{\ldots}As for the semantics of preposed quantifiers, the Northern Sotho example in (7a) is reperted to have an additional meaning of emphasis. The Mbalanhu example is reported not to differ in meaning from the sentence containing a postposed quantifier (Fourie, 1992: 107).''

in Northern Sotho, the stem that means `several' cannot be used with uncountable nouns. 

390
Bantu expressions meaning `few'

In some Bantu languages, the adjectives expressing size (small and big) can also be used for expressions of quantity

391
In NS, ``equivalent for English `some' is \textit{-ngwe}''

``The following two observations suggest that the quantity interpretation of \textit{-ngwe} derives from the plural of the head noun so that the important semantic contribution of \textit{-ngwe} is lack of definiteness.''

\textit{-ngwe} can also be used in the singular

392
Mojapelo (2007) suggests that semantically \textit{-ngwe} indicates that the object talked about is unidentifiable to the hearer unless the pragmatic context suggests otherwise. 

COUNTING SYSTEM

(No notes)

393
NEGATION

``N.S., like many other Bantu languages, does not have a negative quantifier in the nominal domain (see also Malete, 2003). Negative quantification is expressed by negation on the verb{\ldots}''

394
UNIVERSAL QUANTIFIERS

``For the quantifier expressing totality `all' and for the universal distributive quantifier `every', Bantu languages show different morphological stems and constructions with diverging syntactic and/or semantic properties.''

396

``As a general observation, the distributive universal quantifier `every' is expressed in a morphologically complex way or by a loan word in the Bantu languages under inspection for this article. It often shows morphosyntactic features that diverge from adnominal modifiers. In Swahili, the Arabic loan \textit{kila} is used. \textit{Kila} does not agree with the quantified noun in noun class features, and strictly precedes the noun{\ldots}''

``In Swahili, both \textit{kila} and \textit{-ote} can have a distributive reading. 

In light of some data presented in this text, a reviewer suggested that ``\textit{kila} is inherently distributive whereas \textit{-ote} is underspecified concerning the distributive/collective distinction.''

397

``In both Swahili and Northern Sotho, the universal quantifiers also allow for a free choice interpretation, i.e. that the speaker offers the addresee the choice of referent; the sentence will hold with any choice.

(Free choice = anyone, any people whatsoever, any house whatsoever)

398
PROPORTIONALITY QUANTIFIERS
``Proportionality quantifiers are expressed by complex (morpho)-syntactic constructions in Bantu languages.''


MOST `is not a morphological stem in many Bantu languages but is rendered by an analytical morphological construction.'

``The status of the construction that indicates that half of the members from a given set are participating in an event needs further investigation.''



399
Associative construction (discussion; Adams 2005 analyzes it as partitive)

``The quantifiers `many', `some', `each,' and `one' can consequently be used both with a proportional and with an absolute interpretation. In the proportional interpretation they need a restriction on the set over which they quantify. The restriciton is encoded by means of the associative construction.''

400
In ZULU, all cannot participate in this partitive construction.
